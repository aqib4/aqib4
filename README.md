MERN Stack Developer | React • Node • AWS • PostgreSQL

Hi, I’m Muhammad Aqib — a MERN Stack Developer focused on building real-world, scalable web applications. I work with React, Node.js, modern cloud platforms, and real-time systems to create production-ready software.

I enjoy building applications that involve authentication, dashboards, payments, messaging, and cloud infrastructure rather than just simple CRUD apps.

Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Prisma
